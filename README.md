# Spin-up Your Own Wormholes Node

Running your node benefits you a lot, including opening more possibilities, and helping to support the ecosystem. This
page will guide you through spinning up your node and taking part in validating Wormholes transactions.

## The Approach

The significant step before spinning up your node is choosing your approach. Based on requirements and many potential possibilities,
you must select the client implementation (of both execution and consensus clients), the environment (hardware, system), and the
parameters for client settings.

To decide whether to run the software on your hardware or in the cloud depending on your demands.

You can use the startup script to start your node after preparing the environment.

When the node is running and syncing, you are ready to use it, but make sure to keep an eye on its maintenance.

### Environment and Hardware

Wormholes clients are able to run on consumer-grade computers and do not require any special hardware, such as mining machines.
Therefore, you have more options for deploying the node based on your demands. let us think about running a node on both a local
physical machine and a cloud server:

#### Hardware

Wormholes clients can run on your computer, laptop, server, or even a single-board computer. Although running clients on
different devices are possible, it had better use a dedicated machine to enhance its performance and underpin the security,
which can minimize the impact on your computer.

Hardware requirements differ by the client but generally are not that high since the node just needs to stay synced.

Do not confuse it with mining, which requires much more computing power. However , sync time and performance do improve with more
powerful hardware.

#### Minimum requirements

-  CPU: Main frequency 2.9GHz, 4 cores or above CPU.
-  Memory: Capacity 8GB or more.
-  Hard Disk: Capacity 500GB or more.
-  Network bandwidth: 6M uplink and downlink peer-to-peer rate or higher

Before installing the client, please ensure your computer has enough resources to run it. You can find the minimum and recommended requirements below.


## Spinning Up the Node

The actual client setup can be done by using the automatic launcher or manually.

For ordinary users, we recommend you use a startup script, which guides you through the installation and automates the client setup process. However,
if you have experience with the terminal, the manual setup steps should be easy to follow.

### Startup parameters

- Start ***Wormholes*** in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with
  the ***--syncmode*** flag),causing it to download more data in exchange for
  avoiding processing the entire history of the Wormholes Chain network,
  which is very CPU intensive.

- Start up***Wormholes's*** built-in interactive JavaScript,(via the trailing
  ***console*** subcommand) through which you can interact using ***web3***
  [methods](https://learnblockchain.cn/docs/web3.js/getting-started.html)
  (note: the ***web3*** version bundled within ***Wormholes*** is very old, and
  not up to date with official docs), as well as ***Wormholes's*** own [management APIs](https://www.wormholes.com/docs/management/) .
  This tool is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already runningÂ ``Wormholes``
  instance with ***Wormholes attach*** .


### Manual clients setup

Ordinary users can start a node more conveniently by using a startup script. Details are as follows:

#### Full nodes functions

-  Stores the full blockchain history on disk and can answer the data request from the network.
-  Receives and validates the new blocks and transactions.
-  Verifies the states of every account.

#### Start ordinary node

1. Download the binary, config and genesis files from [release](https://github.com/wormholes-org/wormholes),
   or compile the binary by ``make wormholes``.

2. 2.Start your full node

   ````

      # Ordinary nodes need to be started in full mode
      ./wormholes --devnet --syncmode=full

   ````

#### Start validator node

1. Download the binary, config and genesis files from
   [release](https://github.com/wormholes-org/wormholes>),
   or compile the binary by ``make wormholes``.

2. 2.Prepare an account(with more than 70,000 ERB), which can be generated by using MetaMask or other preferred platforms.


3. Prepare a script to start the node, and name it run_node (If the system is windows, you need to add the file suffix .bat),
   or something else. Note that the script should be in the same directory as the main Wormholes program.

   If you are using the windows system, the reference is as follows:

   ````
      
      @echo off
      set rootPath=%~dp0
      set nodePath=%rootPath%.wormholes
      if exist %nodePath% (
	   rd /s/q %nodePath%
      )

      md %nodePath%\geth
      echo %1 > %nodePath%\geth\nodekey

      wormholes.exe --devnet --datadir %nodePath% --mine --syncmode=full
   
   ````

   If you are using a Linux system, the reference is as follows:

   ````
      
      #!/bin/bash
      # write private key to file
      if [ -d .wormholes ]; then
         rm -rf .wormholes
      fi
      mkdir -p .wormholes/wormholes
      echo $1>.wormholes/wormholes/nodekey
      ./wormholes --devnet --datadir .wormholes --syncmode=full
   
   ````

4. Start node

   If you are using the windows system, run the bat script directly.

   If you are using a Linux system, run the shell script and pass in the private key of the pledge account, the reference is as follows:

   ````

      #linux system
      #Runtime parameter -- private key
      sh ./run_node 94b796b1b11893561c34cf000f23ecf3b39067bb198b9ec9f7b1a79646114680

      #windows system
      #Go to the directory where the startup script is located in the CMD terminal
      ./run_node.bat 94b796b1b11893561c34cf000f23ecf3b39067bb198b9ec9f7b1a79646114680

   ````


5. Become a miner by sending a staking transaction

   .. Note::

   The minimum threshold to become a validator is 70,000 ERB. The more you stake,the more likely you are to be chosen as the validator (and recipient of rewards for) that block.

   You can send transactions via Wormholes Wallet or curl command or other means. If you use the Wormholes Wallet, you need to connect to the network you want to join firstly,
   then select the ``Become a Validator`` option and stake the ERB necessary to become a miner. Refer to
   [Wallet](https://www.wormholestest.com/wallet/#/wallet)
